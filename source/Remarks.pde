This animation is a game of downhill skiing.
Its functions are broken down as follows:

Arrays were used to create a set of coordinates for the trees, both x and y coordinates.
A loop then calls the tree methods and populates it with the variables from the array.
As the game runs, these values are adjusted and redrawn to create the affect of movement.

Most methods in the game are of type void, therefore return no value.
However, a method called chooseLevel returns a value based on user input and 
this is assigned to the integer speed variable at which the games speed operates.
                   ********************************
JOption:
Input Display for selecting difficulty level.

Display window at the end shows time played in game.

There is also a user input selection for continuing or stopping (Yes,No).
Based on the answer, the program stops or begins again.
                   ********************************
Controls for the game are based on the keyCode, arrow keys as well as control key to stop movement of skeer.
                   ********************************
Problems/faults:
The only issue I have is I am at present unable to check for exemptions on user input.
Entering letters when I wish only a select few numbers give an error or restrict input to only a few numbers.
